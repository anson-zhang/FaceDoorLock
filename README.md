Face Door Lock based on Raspberry PI

Environment: Python 2.7 + Opencv 2 + Apache + PHP + Raspberry PI

If you download it from github, you should create three new folders:

FaceKeys: Place for the selfies

Faces: Place for the faces in the selfies

visitors: Place for the shots of visitors

Prgramme "recognize.py" is running on Raspberry PI. When you tap 't' in the keyboard, the programme will automatically detect the face in front of the camera and compare it to the keys. And tap 'q' in the keyboard means exit. Remember to train before recognize.
